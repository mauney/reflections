When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    A remote repository is useful for collaborating with other people on the
    same project, for accessing project files myself from different computers
    and locations, and for having an off-site backup of files.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If a feature or bug fix has been assigned to one person, it would be best to
    complete the work before making it available to all. Otherwise, people might
    branch from an unstable commit.
